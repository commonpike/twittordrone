PyBorg ChangeLog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v1.0.6 - 29/4/2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added !rebuilddict command. I suggest you run this command when using
1.0.6 for the first time with an old dictionary.

* Added !checkdict command, which fixes broken links in the dictionary.

* Speeded up the !unlearn command. It's a shitload faster now. A fucking
metric shitload to be accurate.

* Speeded up the learn routines. It's now also a greased up silent night
necrophile load faster.

v1.0.5 - 11/3/2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Don't need the borg.chans workaround anymore.

* (pyborg-irc) Fixed crash in stealth mode when non-owner types '!'...

v1.0.4 - 24/1/2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Catch exceptions and give the user a chance to save that
morbidly large dictionary formed while hanging around on dalnet #sex...

* Changed !learn and !nolearn to a single !learning [on|off] command.

* The !help command now only lists the commands briefly, and !help <command>
gives a more in depth explaination of an individual command.

* Output of !help sent to remote user again, since it is smaller now and
won't get the bot killed for flooding.

* (pyborg-telnet) Fixed to play properly with that strange windows telnet
client (provided it [windows telnet] is in local echo mode).

* (pyborg-irc) Added a configure option and command 'quitmsg', to set
the pyborg quit message. We now properly quit from irc sessions.

* (pyborg-irc) Pyborg listens to CTCP ACTIONs again (broken since moving
to irclib 0.3.x)

v1.0.3 - 10/11/2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Stealth mode (!stealth on|off) to disable non owner
commands and lie about our CTCP version.

* Fixed stupid bug where the bot copied people exactly.

* Changed to official irclib 0.3.2, which has the fixes mentioned
in changes for 1.0.2.

* Owner command security fix (thanks #q3f people)

v1.0.2 - 18/7/2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed bug which made dictionaries saved in win32 and in unix
incompatible.

* Fixed bug in irclib 0.3.1 where removing channel user limits
crashes the bot.

* Fixed bug in irclib 0.3.1 where joining a channel with a capital
W in the name crashes the bot.

v1.0.1 - 19/6/2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Changed to use irclib 0.3.1

v1.0.0 - 22/5/2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Must use convert.py on pyborg 0.9.10 and 0.9.11 dictionaries.

* Faster dictionary load/save and slightly lower memory usage

* (pyborg-irc) On join and kick replies now obey reply rate.

* (pyborg-irc) Optional mIRC colour filtering

* (pyborg-irc) Optional censoring of words.

* (pyborg-irc) Double chance of replying to messages containing own nickname

* (pyborg-telnet) Telnet server module.

* Lots of other stuff i've forgotten
