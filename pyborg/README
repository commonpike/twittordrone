PyBorg 1.0.6 needs Python 1.5.2 or greater (www.python.org). The 'irclib'
and 'ircbot' modules in the PyBorg archive were written by Joel Rosdahl
(www.rosdahl.net). PyBorg has been tested on linux and /may/ work on other
Python platforms.

Edit pyborg.cfg, and pyborg-irc.cfg (created the first time you run pyborg-irc)
to configure the bot. Type !help for a list of commands, and !help <command>
for specifics about that command.

'python pyborg-linein.py' to chat with the bot offline.
'python pyborg-irc.py' for irc mode.

Use convert.py to convert pyborg 0.9.10/11 dictionaries to pyborg 1.0
format. The dictionary is stored in lines.dat and words.dat and backed up
automatically to lines.bak and words.bak in case something strange happens
and the dictionary gets nuked.

NOTE: Terminate the borg with the !quit command or CTRL-C in the
console. Do not simply close the console window or the dictionary
will not be saved.
